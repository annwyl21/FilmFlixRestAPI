FilmFlix Python App with database 

Introduction 

You have been asked to develop a command line python application for FilmFlix, to manage their film database. As a start-up FilmFlix have no more than 40 records of films in their database. A database developer volunteered to work with FilmFlix a while back to develop their database and for ease of use and integration implemented SQLite3 SQL database. However, due to unforeseen circumstance the developer is unable to connect the database with python application, but a copy of the SQLite database has been made available for you to work with if you chose to. Otherwise, you can create the database using SQLite.

CRUD: Create Read Update Delete.

Database name filmflix.db
