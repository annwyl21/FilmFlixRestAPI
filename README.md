# Extended Bootcamp Project - Film Flix Database

### Build a python app to handle CRUD operations on a given database - Film Flix

- My robust app can be found on replit
	- [command line app on replit](https://replit.com/@EllenAsh1/ChocolateDigitalDecagons)
	- my app manages basic CRUD operations
	- can handle user-input mistakes
	- and has a logging output which logs when CRUD operations are performed
	- and some string formatting for command line results

I extended this project by building a RestAPI.
- my RestAPI is available on render 
	- [RestAPI on render](https://filmflixrestapi.onrender.com/api/films)
	- my api can receive json
	- return json
	- has no front end UI
	- connects to the given FilmFlix database initially containing 37 films

I further extended this project by building 2 connections to my API
1 A [jupyter notebook]() which uses the json to generate basic statistics
	- the json is put into a pandas dataframe
	- matplotlib is used to generate statistics
2 A basic [flask app]() which can be used to carry out CRUD operations
--I have better examples of Flask App UI's, this is purely to focus on demonstrating my knowledge of back-end operations.--
